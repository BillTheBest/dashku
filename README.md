Dashku - open source edition (beta)
===

Welcome to the open source edition of Dashku.

Dashku is a SocketStream application that let's you build real-time Dashboard and Widgets using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The application was a prototype, and was well-received. We would like to share it with everyone, so we've decided to make it open source.

Enjoy.
